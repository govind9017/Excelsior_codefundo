Codefundo++ Hackathon (How to save lives and prevent economic losses from Natural Disasters)

Idea for Codefundo++ :-

Natural disasters can strike upon any time without people being prepared for it leading to a major loss of life and causing disruption.
Predicting these disasters is a task that is being researched by a lot of people and organizations.
Being prepared for disasters can prevent a substantial loss of humankind.
We aim to develop an app that uses prediction from various resources and help people get as safe as possible. Also aiding rescue teams in their task to provide resources to people and finally rescue them.
We also look at how technology can be used before and after the disaster to figure out resources that might be needed and rescuing people respectively.

(Idea for a "Saviour" App):

Alerting for disasters :
 - Warning people about an incoming disaster and informing them about the nearest safe place where they can seek shelter.
 - These shelters should be constructed or assigned by an organization. Accordingly, a map can be constructed to identify the nearest safe place for a person based on his/her live location.
 - At these shelters, the count of people can be recorded and resources for them can be provided once the rescue teams come for their service.

Developing an app for the same to perform the following functions:
- Pop up a warning alerting the user about an incoming disaster.
- Comes with an interactive chatbot with safety measures to be adopted in the time of a particular disaster.
- Guide the user to the nearest shelter spot if possible or according to the disaster, guide the user to the safest possible place in his or her immediate surroundings with the amenities that can be grabbed in the time window before the disaster strikes.
- Family members can be a part of a group on the app which allows them to mark themselves safe and inform others about their location.
- Rescue team can grab the necessary information from the app helping them in providing the resources and rescuing them
- Alert about the incoming disaster through organizations and designated people that work in predicting the natural disasters, and also through social media about traveling cyclones, hurricanes and other disasters of the same nature.

Preparing for disasters to help manage in case they strike:
Image analysis from satellite to predict resources required at buildings and areas according to an earthquake Richter level scale, and provide resources accordingly.
Also to figure out what all nearby places can help in providing resources.

After disasters to aid victims:
Image analysis through UAVs will tell us about people that need to be rescued for instance are buried under debris and inform the rescue teams.
